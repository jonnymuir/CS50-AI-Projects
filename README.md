# CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the projects from the CS50 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

**Projects:**

* **Project 0: Degrees** 
    * Implements the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" concept, finding the shortest path between two actors in a movie database using graph algorithms.

* **Project 1: Search** 
    * Solves various search problems, such as finding the shortest path in a maze or solving Sudoku puzzles, using search algorithms like depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A*.

* **Project 2: Minesweeper** 
    * Develops an AI agent that plays the game of Minesweeper, learning to identify safe and mined squares.

**Technologies:**

* Python
